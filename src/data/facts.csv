ca,0,NAME is a 25-year-old chef in California.,
ca,1,They moved there right out of college and started working as a chef at a friend of a friend of a friend’s restaurant.,
ca,2,"Their second night on the job, they met their partner. They’ve been together ever since. Going on 3 years.",
ca,3,"During year 2, NAME’s partner’s sister couldn’t take care of her twins anymore, so they suddenly went from uncles to dads. ",
ca,4,"Growing up, they never envisioned having kids. Mostly because “having kids” meant doing it the natural way. And well, NAME, was transgender.",
ca,5,"After years of being out of place in their own body, they had top surgery and were taking testosterone. But that joy came to an abrupt halt. NAME got pregnant.",
ca,6,"NAME was happy with their life: their partner, their two adopted children, even their cramped apartment. They didn’t want to be pregnant. So they wanted an abortion.",
ca,7,"NAME’s partner worked at a hospital, so they went there, but NAME was misgendered and denied prescribe abortion medication because of the hospital's religious affiliated.",
ca,8,"Defeated, they went home and began to mindlessly scroll through their social feeds. Suddenly they saw an ad for LGBTQ+ telehealth abortion care.",
ca,9,"They could order the pills. NAME was relieved, but California’s abortion maze should have been simpler.",

fl,0,NAME is a 33-year-old woman in Florida.,
fl,1,"On the day before Thanksgiving, NAME, her husband, and their 8-year-old son went to her scheduled ultrasound. NAME was 23 weeks pregnant.",
fl,2,"They were all excited about the possibility of a new sibling, but their excitement turned to fear when the technician suddenly left the room to get the doctor.",
fl,3,"NAME’s baby had no right kidney, had too little amniotic fluid, and had a swollen heart. She was told her baby was “incompatible with life.”",
fl,4,"The baby would likely be stillborn or would die within minutes, or at most hours, after birth. NAME was also at risk of preeclampsia, a potentially deadly complication.",
fl,6,"She was advised to seek care out-of-state, but NAME and her husband didn’t have the money to travel. So, she carried her baby for 13 more weeks, knowing it would die",
fl,5,NAME was well past Florida’s 15-week abortion limit and her doctor would not terminate the pregnancy because of the state’s other restrictions.,
fl,7,"Those weeks were gut wrenching and NAME started experiencing extreme depression and anxiety for the first time in her life. At 37 weeks, doctors induced labor.",
fl,8,"NAME and her husband watched their baby take his first breath, and then 94 minutes later, watched it take his last. The experience shattered NAME’s family. ",
fl,9,"Her 8-year-old had his dreams of becoming a big brother ripped away, and her relationship with her husband was strained. Florida’s abortion maze created this trauma.",

mi,0,NAME is a 17-year-old girl in Michigan.,
mi,1,"She has been in the foster system since she was 3 and has been bounced around to 4 maybe 5 families. So, the idea of “love” — it’s pretty confusing.",
mi,2,"But her boyfriend is her home. They’ve had sex a few times. Her school doesn’t mandate sex ed, so she's picked up things from her friends and the internet. ",
mi,3,"She’s been told that you should only have sex when you’re married and when you’re ready to start a family, but like “love,” “family” is hard to imagine for NAME.",
mi,4,"Right after senior year starts, NAME notices that she hasn’t gotten her period. She tries to stay calm, but a week and two positive pregnancy tests later, she panics.",
mi,5,NAME and her boyfriend decide that getting an abortion is their best option. They make an appointment at the nearest clinic. ,
mi,6,"While filling out the paperwork, they realize they’re missing an important piece under Michigan law: parental consent. NAME hasn’t talked to her parents in 14 years.",
mi,7,"NAME files a petition to waive parental consent, but the judge rejects it  saying she “lacked sufficient maturity” and that the “waiver was not in her best interest.” ",
mi,8,"NAME files an appeal, and it is granted. The next day NAME and her boyfriend return to the clinic. ",
mi,9,"He holds her hand and cries with her. They know they are doing the right thing, but Michigan’s abortion maze doesn’t make it any easier.",

oh,2,"She lives with her mom and her mom’s live in boyfriend. Her mom is nice and funny, but the boyfriend makes NAME do things she doesn’t like to do.",
oh,3,"The first time this happened, she was scared so she didn’t tell anyone. After the second time, NAME started to feel funny, so she confided in her mom.",
oh,4,Her mom gave her a name for what had happened: rape. NAME was just over 6 weeks pregnant. She needed an abortion. ,
oh,5,"But her home state, Ohio, banned them after 6 weeks with no exceptions for rape so they were forced to drive out of state.",
oh,6,"It was all very scary for NAME. The procedure was painful, but everyone told her she was brave — even her mom, who’s eyes were wet with sadness.",
oh,7,"The doctor that performed her abortion, shared NAME’s story anonymously and soon it was all over the news. The doctor was under investigation too.",
oh,8,Her mom’s old boyfriend was sentenced to jail. NAME couldn’t help but think all of this was her fault.,
oh,9,"But, it wasn’t. Not the rape. Not the abortion. Not Ohio’s abortion maze that she had to find a way through.",

tn,0,NAME is a 32-year-old mother of four in Tennessee.,
tn,1,"Five months after the birth of her 3rd child, she was shocked to learn she was pregnant again despite taking birth control.",
tn,2,Her 8-month ultrasound showed that the embryo had become implanted in scar tissue from her recent cesarean section — an ectopic pregnancy. Her life was at risk.,
tn,3,"But in just hours, the state of Tennessee would ban abortion following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling.",
tn,4," There was no exception in case of risk to the mother's life, and anyone who performed an abortion could be charged with a felony.",
tn,5,"NAME thought about traveling out of state for an abortion, but it was costly and she had other children to care for, plus other states had waiting period restrictions.",
tn,6,"So, she waited. At 26 weeks she started bleeding and was rushed to the hospital. NAME had an emergency C-section where doctors pulled about a baby girl. ",
tn,7,"They weren’t sure if either the baby or NAME would survive. At first, the baby girl had trouble breathing on her own — her lungs weren’t fully developed. ",
tn,8,"NAME had a giant vertical gash that ran the length of her abdomen. There was so much damage, she would never have another child.",
tn,9,"After spending close to 2 months in the hospital, NAME took the baby girl home. They had made it through Tennessee’s abortion maze, but not without lasting scars.",
tx,0,NAME is a 38-year-old lawyer in Texas.,
tx,1,"She never pictured herself having children, and when she finds herself pregnant, that just reaffirms her position. She wanted an abortion.",
tx,2,"NAME felt that getting pills through the mail was unnecessarily difficult and uncertain, especially with all of the lawsuits swirling in her state. But Mexico was close.",
tx,3,She didn’t tell any of her family because she didn’t think they would approve. NAME just picked a long weekend and started driving.,
tx,4,"It took her about 5 hours, including the delay at border crossing, to get to her destination.",
tx,5,"NAME had read up on “medical tourism” — where people cross the border for cheaper care — and she knew where to go, a supermarket with a big pharmacy in the center.",
tx,6,She scrambled together a string of Spanish and asked the pharmacist for the medication. No questions asked. $25. And that was it.,
tx,7,"While at the market, NAME bought everything she would need for the next two days. Then she checked into her hotel. ",
tx,8,"She was nervous following the online instructions alone, but she popped the pill under her tongue. The cramping and bleeding started about 4 hours later. ",
tx,9,"NAME thought “unpleasant” was an understatement describing it, but she was lucky to have the ability to do this. The Texas abortion maze just made everything harder.",
