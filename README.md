# United Mazes of Abortion Bans

This is a [story](https://unitedstatesofabortionbans.com/) about abortion access 1 year after Roe v. Wade was struck down. It's built in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).


## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Change the script in `package.json` to `"dev": "svelte-kit dev --host"` to test on your local network on a different device.

## Deploy

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a directory called `build` with the statically rendered app.

A shortcut for github pages:

```bash
make github
```

## Notes
- Running `npm run gdoc` will fetch the latest copy from all Google Docs and Sheets.
